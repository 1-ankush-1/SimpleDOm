- create a server.js file
- npm init -y
- tsc --init
- rename server.js to server.ts
    -now inside the server.ts it will not recognise require("express) because it doent know file will run or server or webbrowser
        - install this @types/node (means we can use nodejs syntex with typescript means doing translation)
            npm i --save-dev @types/node
    - now we can not get the sugestion what is insde the library suggestion
        - install it for express(we can also find for other library as well just change the name check on google first)
            npm install --save-dev @types/express
        and add this in tsconfig.json in complierOptions
            "moduleResolution": "node",
        - it still wont give suggestion
            - either we can use 
                import express = require("express");
                    OR 
                import express from "express";
            (but when we compile it from typescript to javascript it compiled down to the require syntex in app.js)
- separate js from ts
    - open tsconfig.json
    - go to Emit and give some path to store js files
    - "outDir": "./dist",
    - separate ts to so  
    - give path insdie the where you moved the ts files
    - "rootDir": "./app", 

imp - run tsc command before starting npm server
